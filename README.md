- 👋 Hi, I’m Jesus
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in programming video games, web pages, applications and everything that has to do with programming, 
- I really like to experiment and try new things, 
- I like to do everything my mind wants to do and it is interesting to create new things.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning languages like php, css and html
- 
- 💞️ At the moment I'm not looking to collaborate on something, I'm learning and I don't feel able to collaborate on any project (at least right now)
- 
- 📫 To contact me you can send me an email to "thesrjesus.indie@gmail.com" 
- to contact me! If I take a long time to respond, I will surely be programming something new
